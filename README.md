# Introduction
This Xcode project serves as a tutorial for how to get started integrating the Braze iOS SDK.

The framework of this project (Swift) is already built out such that all that needs to be added is the Braze SDK and relevant methods to start logging user data. You don't need to know much about Swift to get going here.

The framework of this application (Swift / Xcode) is already built out such that all that needs to be added is the Braze SDK channel integration.
